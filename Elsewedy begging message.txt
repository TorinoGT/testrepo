Hello Elsewedy Electric,

My name is Nour Eddin Alchmri, a 4th year Computer Engineering student.
I applied to your job posting for a Cybersecurity Intern position.

In addition to my technical experience from Ajman University, I gained a good amount of general cybersecurity and networking expertise with:
1) Utilizing range of security tools (nmap, burp suite, metasploit etc.) from Kali Linux and Parrot Security OS to perform specific tasks like pentesting, cryptography, reconnaisance etc.
2) Python to automate basic security auditing
3) Wireshark to monitor and inspect network traffic
4) Packet Tracer to simulate performance and security of network configurations
and more. 

Additionally, I accumulated certificates from reputable organizations such as the Google Cybersecurity Certification, CEH v12 (in progress) and various certificates from Coursera, Cisco and Huawei.
As someone who is passionate about networking and security, I believe I can bring a lot to the table and learn lots of valuable experience from experts in the company.
